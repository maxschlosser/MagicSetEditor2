Localized strings

A 'localized string' is a [[type:map]] of [[type::string]]s, indexed by locale name.
It is used to translate games and stylesheets to other user interface languages.

Localized strings can be given with a @localized@ prefix on the property name.
For example, a field has a @description@ which is a [[type::string]], and a @localized_description@ for localized variants. So

>field:
>	name: cost
>	description: How much this card costs
>	localized description:
>		en_US: How much this card costs
>		nl_NL: Hoeveel deze kaart kost
